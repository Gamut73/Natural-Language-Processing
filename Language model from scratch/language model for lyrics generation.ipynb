The way I like to do this window is use `range` to take steps of size `n_steps` from $0$ to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of tokens in each sequence. That way, the integers you get from `range` always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `seq_length` wide."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-04T11:11:18.392466Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-04T11:11:18.392702Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-04T11:11:18.402456Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-04T11:11:18.392671Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-04T11:11:18.401761Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"_q31xex982dC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633887151742,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":52,"user":{"displayName":"Walter Musara","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjEc4VgM4cXPSQ7Lw0EacolEWvCsyx0TU72t378xg=s64","userId":"17999767020252423639"}}},"source":["def get_batches(arr, batch_size, seq_length):\n","    '''Create a generator that returns batches of size\n","       batch_size x seq_length from arr.\n","       \n","       Arguments\n","       ---------\n","       arr: Array you want to make batches from\n","       batch_size: Batch size, the number of sequences per batch\n","       seq_length: Number of encoded chars in a sequence\n","    '''\n","    \n","    batch_size_total = batch_size * seq_length\n","    # total number of batches we can make, // integer division, round down\n","    n_batches = len(arr)//batch_size_total\n","    \n","    # Keep only enough characters to make full batches\n","    arr = arr[:n_batches * batch_size_total]\n","    # Reshape into batch_size rows, n. of first row is the batch size, the other lenght is inferred\n","    arr = arr.reshape((batch_size, -1))\n","    \n","    # iterate through the array, one sequence at a time\n","    for n in range(0, arr.shape[1], seq_length):\n","        # The features\n","        x = arr[:, n:n+seq_length]\n","        \n","        # The targets, shifted by one\n","        y = np.zeros((x.shape), dtype=x.dtype)\n","        try:\n","          y[:, :-1], y[:, -1] = x[:, 1:], arr[:, n+seq_length]\n","        except IndexError:\n","          y[:, :-1], y[:, -1] = x[:, 1:], arr[:, 0]\n","\n","        \n","        yield x, y \n","        \n","#when we call get batches we are going \n","#to create a generator that iteratest through our array and returns x, y with yield command\n"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ls9f0FCX82dD"},"source":["\n","# Test Your Implementation\n","\n","Now let's make some data sets and we can check out what's going on as we batch data.
