Who said that you could go, I'm losing my past. Who said we had to go and learn from our mistakes. Oh ooh. That's the way it goes, ah, ha. Whether you like it honey, that's the way it goes, yeah, uh. You take your dirty love, instead you like it. You know that something (unknown lyric) to the love in my eyes. The sun beats down and oh. When your love is down, you look up to the skies. And ohhh, yeah, ohh, oh, ooh, ooh. Yeah (unknown lyric) like it. When you've got to go, you say you've got to go. That's the way it goes, yeah. That's the way I like it, ahh. You don't have to show me, oh, oohhh. 'Cos that's the way it goes, yeah, haa. That's the way that's gone and on. Hey, you better make up your mind soon, hey, hey. That's the way it goes, yeah, baby. You can see your baby, you get up and say. If you take your time, let me down then say. It's too late to go, ha. It's too late to go, haa. So I can be as good as I want. I can do all the stuff, like to win a game.
