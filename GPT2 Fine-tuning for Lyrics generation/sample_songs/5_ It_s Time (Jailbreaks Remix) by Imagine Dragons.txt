So this is what you meant?. When you said that you were spent. And now it's time to build from the bottom. Of the pit right to the top. Don't hold back. Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check. I don't ever want to let you down. I don't ever want to leave this town. 'Cause after all. This city never sleeps at night. It's time to begin, isn't it. I get a little bit. Bigger, but then, I'll admit. I'm just the same as I was. Now don't you understand. That I'm never changing who I am. So this is where you fell. And I am left to sell. The path that heaven runs through miles. Of clouded hell, right to. The top. Don't look back. Turning to rags and give the commodities a rain-check. I don't ever want to let you down. I don't ever want to leave this town. 'Cause after all. This city never sleeps at night. It's time to begin, isn't it, I get a little bit. Bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as i was. Now don't you understand. That i'm never changing who I am. It's time to begin, isn't it, I get a little bit. Bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was. Now don't you understand. That i'm never changing who I am. This road never looked so lonely. This house doesn't burn down slowly. To ashes, to ashes. It's time to begin, isn't it, I get a little bit. Bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as i was. Now don't you understand. That I'm never changing who I am. It's time to begin, isn't it, I get a little bit. Bigger, but then, I'll admit, I'm just the same as i was. Now don't you understand. That i'm never changing who I am.
